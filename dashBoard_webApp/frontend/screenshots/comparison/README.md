## UI/UX Redesign

### Evolution from v1 to v1.2

#### 📊 Theme and Readability

The initial interface used a **high-contrast dark theme**, with dense cards and less obvious visual hierarchy, making it more difficult to **quickly read key information** on the dashboard.

The new version adopts a **more spacious light theme**, with more negative space and a better-defined card structure, which improves:
- Overall **interface readability**
- **Immediate understanding** of the safety score and its evolution
- Positive contrast and visual fluidity

#### 🎨 Color Palette

The color choices are not random but **inspired by the three colors of Lloyd's logo**, reinforcing visual alignment with the insurance brand and creating cohesion between products.

#### ♿ Accessibility Options

v1.2 introduces a **comprehensive customization panel** to meet diverse user needs and improve overall accessibility:

- **Light/dark theme**: Switch between modes to adapt the interface to visual preferences and lighting conditions
- **Animation control**: Disable transitions and animated effects to reduce distractions and improve performance
- **Font size adjustment**: Customize text readability according to visual comfort needs
- **Language selection**: Multilingual support for international use
- **Profile customization**: Adapt the interface to individual preferences of each driver
