# Offline Speed Limit Detection System (OSM-Based)

This project provides a **fully offline speed-limit detection module** using
**OpenStreetMap (.osm.pbf)** data.  
It takes real-time GPS coordinates and vehicle speed, then determines whether the
driver is **under or over the legal speed limit** of the road they are currently on.

It uses:

- **OpenStreetMap** as the road and speed-limit database  
- **Pyrosm** to extract road geometries and maxspeed tags  
- **Shapely** for geometry handling  
- **SciPy KDTree** for fast nearest-road lookup  
- **Numpy / Pandas** for efficient data processing  

The workflow is 100% offline and suitable for embedded or real-time applications.

## Features

- Load a local `.osm.pbf` map file (Tunisia, France, Germany, etc.)
- Extract all road geometries + speed limits (`maxspeed`)
- Build a high-performance KD-Tree for nearest-road lookup
- For each GPS sample:
  - find the nearest road  
  - read its legal speed limit  
  - compare with the vehicle's speed  
  - apply tolerance logic  
  - return **OK** or **OVER_SPEED**  
- Works in real-time and offline (no internet required)
